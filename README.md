# General Angular Demos

Welcome to my repository for basic Angular demos.  The repository exists mainly
for the demos that don't really fit into the categories of other repositories that I've created.

### Simple UI Router Menu

This demo shows how you can watch for state changes and build a menu/navigation system that
works nicely with Angular's ui-router.

### Advanced UI Router Menu and Navigation

This demo, like hte simple ui-route menu demo, shows how you can build an interactive
menu system and interact with the user.

This demo goes a step beyond and lets you tie into services to track changes,
let the ui-router state controllers tell the service if they are dirty, prevent
navigation where appropriate, and utilizes modal dialogs to allow the user to
control the work flow.  It is promise/callback driven and works well for state
tracking and integration.
